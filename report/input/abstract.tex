Next to sharp interface models for the description and prediction of crack growth, diffuse interface models represent a powerful method so as to model cracks and their propagation. This work focuses on a phase-field description of dynamic fracture. Considering brittle fracture, the variational formulation of the problem is presented and the phase-field theory is introduced. The resulting coupled systems of partial differential equations are given. A fourth-order model is exposed by manipulating the crack density functional of the second-order model. In order to numerically approximate their solution, the semidiscrete Galerkin forms of the governing equations are derived. Since the fourth-order model require a higher regularity of the phase-field's solution, a Finite Element Analysis within an Isogeometric Analysis framework is outlined. A time integration scheme for the description of dynamic fracture is sketched. Finally, the major differences between sharp and diffuse interface models are examined and consequently, advantages of using phase-field models are underlined.
