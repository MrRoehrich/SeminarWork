\begin{abstract}
Next to sharp interface models for the description and prediction of crack growth, diffuse interface models represent a powerful method so as to model cracks and their propagation. This work focuses on a phase-field description of dynamic fracture. Considering brittle fracture, the variational formulation of the problem is presented and the phase-field theory is introduced. A fourth-order model is exposed by extending the crack density functional of the second-order model. The resulting coupled systems of partial differential equations as well as the semidiscrete Galerkin forms are given. Since the fourth-order model requires a higher continuity of the phase-field's solution, a finite element analysis within an isogeometric analysis framework is outlined. A time integration scheme, based on the generalized-$\alpha$ method, is sketched for the description of dynamic fracture. The major differences between sharp and diffuse interface models are examined.
